## Liechtenstein remains occupied by the DPRK after South Korean Armed Forces fail to remove occupying North Korean troops

Today at 18:00 BST, Republic of Korean Armed Forces were deployed to Vaduz; the capital of the micro state Liechtenstein in Europe. Vaduz was, and still remains as the hub of North Korea's offshore banking. South Korean forces were deployed to Vaduz with the goal of removing North Korean influence, and protecting the cat population in the region. This however was not the first time South Korean forces had tried to remove the North Koreans regime over Liechtenstein, with this being the 3rd attempt. 

South Korean forces began the battle at approximately 18:15 BST, with South Korean troops arriving via helicopter. The house in which the Head of State of Liechtenstein resides was the main battle ground, which was first taken control by members of the North Korean Korean's People's Army. Eventually the South Korean forces managed to force their way in, capturing the building. However, once the South Korean forces occupied the building, a development bug eas found, which prevented the hard point system from working, causing the server to restart.

Once the server had restarted and 3 minutes after the battle had begun again South Korean forces which were occupying the building before the server had restarted were teleported to the point, however North Lorean forces were already their, which contributed to the South Korean troops to being killed almost instantly. After that, the North Korean forces took the point and occupied it for the rest of the battle contributing to a North Korean victory. However if these technical glitches did not happen, the chance of South Korean forces losing would of been a lot lower, so JimmySavil4, the DPRKs President of the Presidium to call for a 1v1 against President Robloxruler87 on Alpha Planks. A video of the 1v1 can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y34bzKHf06I).
