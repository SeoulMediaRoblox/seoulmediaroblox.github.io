### The ROKAP Chairman uses racist terminology and makes threats
*Written by PwnageL0RD*

Recently, Republic of Korea Army Party (ROKAP) Chairman and National Assembly representative "Yaroslav_Sergvievich" (also known as Yuri and Yaroslav Rurik) was caught in the DPRK server swearing at the "TheEpicM1chael" with a controversial racial slur used against people of African descent. The feud seems to have started from a message Michael about Azov (the Ukrainian Army Regiment) where it seems that the situation quickly degenerated and Yaroslav proceeded to threaten Michael with r**e, alongside with calling him said racial slur multiple times. In the messages that have been linked to this article, you can clearly see that Michael told him that he was a minor, to which Yaroslav continued to make said threats.

Our correspondents decided to try and contact Yaroslav, however received an angry response.

We  also decided to also ask Michael, the person threatened by Yaroslav and he had to say the following things:
*"outrageous and pe*****ic"*
