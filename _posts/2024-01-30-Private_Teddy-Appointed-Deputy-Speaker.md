# Private_Teddy appointed Deputy Speaker

Private_Teddy, currently chairman of the United Income Party has been appointed deputy speaker by three Speaker of the National Assembly.

The post of deputy speaker isn’t one which he’s new to, with him formerly being [elected speaker during January last year](https://seoultoday.github.io/2023/01/15/New-Speaker-23.html). 

The United Income Party is the Republic of Koreas biggest Party, and now has even more representation in the National Assembly with this recent appointment.

This new change can bring activity, or become a travesty - or alternatively not cause any change at all.

We seek to keep you updated.
