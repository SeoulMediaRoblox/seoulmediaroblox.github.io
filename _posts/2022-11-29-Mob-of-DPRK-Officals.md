## Mob of DPRK Government Officials Appear at a Speech by the Minister of Culture and the Prime Minister at the JSA

Today, at around 12:15 when the Minister for Culture, Transport and Sports was making a speech about how South Korea could improve, a mob of members from the Supreme People's Assembly of the DPRK appeared in the Southern side, and took a seat and spectated the speech. It's believed JameSavil4, who's a Cabinet member for DPRK was the one responsible for the surprise appearance. The SPA members would later made Pro-North Korean comments during the speech, until they were killed by members of the Republic Of Korea Army. NIS were instructed not to intervene, unless engaged in combat, or if the Prime Minister and/or the Minister of Culture was put in danger.
