# The January Emergency Presidential Election: The rundown

Over this weekend, the Republic of Korea had an emergency presidential election which was caused by the assassination of former President SirIgglyThe4rd by a Russian spy. Before the results of the emergency presidential election, SirBryanHall stated that the new president would serve the remaining time of Iggly term. 

The candidates who participated in this emergency Presidential Election were Carlos_TheFurry, Josh_Simil and JackDesires. There were two rounds that took place for the election over the weekend. In this article, we will be going over the results of this emergency presidential election.

### Round One Results:

*A total of 189 people voted in this round*

### The Aftermath:
After everything that happened, we would find out that Carlos_TheFurry would win the election by a small majority. Many people immediately said that Carlos_TheFurry party, Democratic Party of Korea or DPK, rigged the election in their favor. This was immediately disproven by a server moderator.

A little bit later, President Carlos_TheFurry would announce his Cabinet which includes CarWetz99 as Minister of National Defence and MartinMJB as Minister of Foreign Affairs who will take the place of Sourish after he resigned from the position. The acting Prime Minister and the previous Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sourish, is set to become the Prime Minister after this emergency presidential election.
