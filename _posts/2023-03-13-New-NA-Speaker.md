## Recent speaker election elects SirBryanHall as Speaker of the National Assembly 

After the resignation and defection of the previous Speaker of the National Assembly, Funzone73, the National Assembly and members of the public were called to vote on an election for a new Speaker of the National Assembly. There were 10 candidates with two of them being disqualified for suspected voter fraud. The top three candidates were as follows: SirBryanHall, Carlos_TheFurry and Tehtii. With Sir Bryan Hall winning, he chose to elect Carlos_TheFurry and Tehtii as both Deputy Speakers of the National Assembly. This comes as Tehtii recently resigned from the role of Minister for Justice before recent Cabinet reshuffles were completed by the President. 

Recently, the National Assembly has been called 'inactive', after a small number of bills were sumbimited by members of the National Assembly, causing a lack of summits to be hosted.
