# Opinion | The constitution needs to change: Here's why.  

  

The constitution created by JimmySavil4 needs to be changed. Here is why.  

The constitution of the Republic of Korea is a document which out lies the principles on how the Government, the people, and the Armed Forces run by. The current version of the constitution was published by Roblox User and Founder in the Republic of Korea Group, JimmySavil4 on the 7th of July.

### What's actually wrong with the constitution? 

**The constitution is written poorly** 

The constitution itself is formatted very poorly, with it not having much of a structure to it. When we have a look at something like the real-life constitution in American, we can see that it is structed in a way that makes sense. The USA constitution has a quite simple structure to it, Articles and Amendments. The Republic of Korea constitution published by JimmySavil4 has no structure to it. It is only split into sections (which are not numbered in any way) and has 0 consistency. This makes it hard for someone like me to reference the actual document.  

**The Ten Articles - what is wrong with them?** 

The Ten Articles itself seems to have nothing wrong with them in my opinion, until it comes to the 7th article. The 7th Article; "The Republic of Korea gives preference to the Nation's Founders who have unlimited authority over all matters of state and military". This gives the 'Founder(s)' of the Republic of Korea the right to do what they like and make decisions regarding the nation as much as they like. Yes, having a group of people who can oversee the Government and organisations like the Republic of Korea Armed Forces is fine in my opinion - that is why we have the Supreme Court, but having someone who has complete control over the ROK except from the Group Holder. 

**The issues with the rights of the President**  

Face it; the President's powers make sense. The only issue that comes is when the Presidential term is 12 months. When a Presidential Term lasts for a Year for a Roblox Nation, it means no opposition against the President can be made. Instead, the President role almost becomes the role of a Founder. The Presidential Term in my opinion should last for around 3 months, meaning we would see 4 President's/per year. This gives each President enough time to make change to South Korea, and to face opposition in elections as well. "But you can just impeach the President and trigger another election!" Impeaching a perfectly fine President makes no sense. Instead, changing the length of the term makes more sense to create a stronger democracy.

**The issues with the Powers of the National Assembly**

The only issue that occurs to me with the Powers of the National Assembly is that they have no authority over the JSA, and the Armed Forces. It makes no sense to not give a democratically elected members of the National Assembly the powers to represent the people, and make laws regarding the JSA and/or the Armed Forces. Any bill that abuses these powers would either be vetoed by the Speakers of the National Assembly, or by the Supreme Court or face masses of criticism from other members of the National Assembly. 

### In conclusion

The constitution does not create a strong democracy. With a few edits made to the constitution - and the abolishment of the Founder Role, we could see a better democracy. One that represents the people, and not the thoughts and opinion of one, but the thoughts and opinion of all.
