## The 7th President, robloxruler87 successfully inaugurated

After a smooth election, President Robloxruler87 was inaugurated into office last Wednesday. The inauguration ceremony was completed as it would normally, with the now President and Prime Minister completing their own speeches, and the President repeating the required oath. The only problem that faced the historical event was the presents of MoSS (Ministry of State Security, the DPRK’s espionage organisation). Only one Agent of the DPRK’s Ministry made close to the President, whom failed to harm him, with them only managing to stab one Cabinet member, who only faced minor injuries.
The new President term is to now last for 4 months in accordance with the constitution, and will end in April.
