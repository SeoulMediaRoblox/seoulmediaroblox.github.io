## Civil War in North Korea - What now?

The Civil War in the North continues between JimmySavil4 and iAmMew_34. The next and, final destination being Pyeongyang. The 2 battles have seen a victory from iAmMew_34's supporters twice. iAmMew_34 has seen the support of the SWC, and other members of the ROK, with JimmySavil4 seeking the support of the North Korean Special Operation Forces, whom have failed their leader twice now. This has in powered the rivalry between the two Special Forces.

The next battle is going to be hosted at a map that represents central-Pyongyang. This map is the same map that the main DPRK group uses to host SSU's and events from time-to-time, however has been reduced in size, and will be missing all civilian teams, and other features to remove any lag. The battle is expected to have a similar result, with iAmMew_34 most likely going to be the one who claims victory, however there is no doubt that JimmySavil4's forces will be trying harder to try and reach victory. The reason this is believed is because of the fact that SWC have one every ACS/FPS scrim against the SOF, and have proven they're more skilled when it comes to this kind of urban combat. We believe the battle will be taking place at 19 November 2022 18:00.
