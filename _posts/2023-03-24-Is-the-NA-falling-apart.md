## The National Assembly half empty

_Written by Josh05485_

Just yesterday, Party Chairman of CFR, AlphaL1m1ted resigned from his position as Chairman, now half of the National Assemblies parties don't have chairman's, these parties are, TKP, JP, CFR, UKP, and DPK. Most of these Party Chairmans were voted out instead of resigning, the only parties that resigned were CFR and JP. JP Chairman Eicdudes83 resigned one day before AlphaL1m1ted, Eic resigned because he wanted to go back to the PPP party, while AlphaL1m1ted resignation reason is still empty, but is suspected for resigning because of personal reasons. Now the National Assembly is slowing losing all legislative power and failing to get anything through, is the National Assembly no longer needed?
