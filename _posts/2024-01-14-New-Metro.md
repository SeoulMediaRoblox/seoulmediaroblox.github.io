## A new metro opened on the Joint Security Area

On the 14th of January, a new metro opened up on the South Korean side of the Joint Security Area. It serves to connect the Republic of Korea Armed Forces Garrison with the Freedom house. This new addition to the Joint Security Area is a great addition and was much needed and provides all South Koreans with a quicker way to move around the Joint Security Area. 

This new service will be especially important during events such as inspections and parades, where citizens would usually have to walk around the map, but this is now avoided. Itâ€™s unknown if anything similar is going to be added to the DPRK. 

*This new metro system can be found by Burger King in the Freedom House and on the other side next to the Republic of Korea Armed Forces Garrison.* 

Journalist Mavo_r was on the ground, and provided Seoul Today with the following images.
