## Minister of Interior bans North Korean defectors

Recently, Minister of the Interior, Parasiel has put a ban that blocks any North Korean defectors and refugees from entering the country. This decision was believed to of been made to bring a stop to North Korea’s Ministry of State Security spies from entering South Korea, and getting ahold of classified material, causing havoc within South Korea and a multitude of other things.

Many people have opposed such decisions, such as North Korean Defector and Chairman of the Korean National Party SirPlatin, who’s created a ‘petition’ alongside the Transition Korea Party that opposes the decision made by the Minister of Interior. In the petition, he lays out 3 reasons why the decision should be repelled, with them being: A better life (for defectors), Contribution to the state, and A beacon of hope and democracy. 

Seoul Today is still awaiting a comment from the Minister of the Interior.
