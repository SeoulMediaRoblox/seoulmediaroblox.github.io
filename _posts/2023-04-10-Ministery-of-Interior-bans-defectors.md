## Minister of Interior puts a ban on North Korean defectors

Recently, Minister of the Interior, Parasiel has put a ban that blocks any North Korean defectors and refugees from entering the country. This decision was believed to of been made in order to bring a stop to the North Korea’s Ministry of State Security spies from entering South Korea, and getting ahold of classified material, causing havoc within South Korea and a multitude of other things.

Many people have opposed such decisions, such as North Korean Defector and Chairman of the Korean Nation Party SirPlantin, who’s created a ‘petition’ along side the Transition Korea Party that opposes the decision made by the Minister of Interior. In the petition he lays out 3 reasons why the decision should be repelled, with them being: A better life (for defectors), Contribution to the state, and A beacon of hope and democracy. 

Seoul Today is still awaiting for a comment from the Minister of the Interior.
