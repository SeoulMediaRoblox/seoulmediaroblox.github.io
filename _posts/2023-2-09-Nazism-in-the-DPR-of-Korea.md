## The DPRK's relations with Nazism

The DPRK holds many ties with  Nazism, but has it gone out of hand? Many people were affected and harmed in Germany from 1939 to 1945 due to the tyranny brought upon those people by the Nazi's. The DPRK now has it's 'New Third Reich' with many high-ranking officials holding ties with the idea's of Nazism. For example, Colonel Sanders, the SOF Commander holds many ties with Nazism he has been at the centre of controversy, with him been caught speaking to president RobloxRuler87 about 'being a Nazi' and 'agreeing with Hitler ideas'. As well as that, he has also been seen with a book as his lock screen on his phone with a picture of the frontcover of a book which has the leader of the Third Reich, Adolf Hitler. This hasn't been the only case, President of the Presidium JimmySavill4 has been eyed by the public, publicly saying "Here are the top 10 reasons I voted for the NSDAP in 1933." Now the DPRK is in a difficult position, either to be connected with a genocidal country or become the country of yesterday.
