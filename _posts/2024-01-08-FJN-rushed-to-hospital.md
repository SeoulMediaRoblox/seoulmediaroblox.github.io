## FJN_GAAMontreaL is rushed to the hospital after suffering a heart attack.

FJN_GAAMontreaL (Also known as FJN) famous former South Korean Prime Minister and politician who temporarily became President after Former President Nocturno's departure has been taken to hospital in breaking news after suffering a heart attack, trusted sources say. 

FJN, a controversial but dedicated politician was well known for his great contributions to this nation, such as the former Constitution and multiple pieces of legislation that has changed South Korea mostly for the better. As the Former Leader of the Democratic Party of Korea (between June - September 2023), he took part in multiple elections, and rallied support behind, and at times against him. 

Rumours have spread that the “doctors have diagnosed him with coronary artery disease”. Whilst Seoul Today can not certify this claim, it seems somewhat reasonable considering his current status. 

Seoul Today wishes the best for his health and future.
