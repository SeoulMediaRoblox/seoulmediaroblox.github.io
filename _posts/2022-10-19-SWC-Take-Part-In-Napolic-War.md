## SWC take part in Napoleonic War based in the 1800's
The Republic Of Korean Army Special Warfare Command took part in a battle in the game called 'Napoleonic Wars', after being called to combat by a commander in need. The SWC performed extremely well, with the Commander of the forces they were assisting being extremely impressed in how they performed, especially since many of them hadn't had that style of combat before. Unfortunately their team had lost, but the SWC held out longer than a group of elites that they were fighting alongside with.
