*A visualization of where the war took place can be found below.*

The Civil War in North Korea is finally over. After 3 large scale battles, between two respect North Korea officials, JimmySavil4, vs iAmMew_34. The 3 battles saw an amazing attendance from all corners of the community. Now that the war is over, people are asking, who won? However, before I explain who won the war, it's first important to look at the timeline of the war, and what events happened and when.

### Time Line
The Civil War was declared on the 1 November 2022 17:04 by JimmySavil4, after iAmMew_34 won the election for the for the role: "President of the Supreme People's Assembly Presidium". The first battle, The Battle of Huyong Guyok, started on the Saturday, 5 November 2022 18:00, with iAmMew_34's forces winning. The second battle, The Battle for Orang International took place on Saturday, 12 November 2022 18:00, with iAmMew_34's forces once again winning. The third, and final battle of the series of battles that took part in the Civil War was the invasion of Pyongyang, Pyongyang being the Captain of the DPRK (North Korea), with the iAmMew_34's forces failing to complete the assassination of JimmySavil4, who was to believed to of been hiding in his bunker, with members of the Supreme Guard Command. The war lasted in total for 18 days (2 weeks and 4 days).

### Who won?
With iAmMew_34's forces winning 2/3 of the battles, but failing to complete the assassination of JimmySavil4 did iAmMew_34 actually win? No, in fact, no one won. However instead iAmMew_34 announced on Saturday, 19 November 2022 18:55: "This civil war has been devastating. It has turned friends into enemies, and undermined faith in the stability of our government. This will sadly leave a stain on our glorious nation for years to come. On behalf of the entire DPRK, I apologize. Manse SirCollinHall!". With JimmySavil4 following up by announcing 2 hours later: "After singing "Why can't we be Friends" by War with @iAmMew_34 on the JSA I can confirm that Korea is one and that we will unite against the true enemy: KCNA journalists."
The real winners? Some say that South Korea are the true victors of this North Korea Civil War.
