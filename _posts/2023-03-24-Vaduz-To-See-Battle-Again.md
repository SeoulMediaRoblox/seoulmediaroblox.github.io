## The Republic of Korea Armed Forces to invade Vaduz, Liechtenstein once again

On Tuesday, President Robloxruler87 announced the first battle for him to lead - the Third Battle of Vaduz. The Republic of Korea Armed Forces he announced are to officially invade the micro-state on the 1st of April, 18:00 UTC. This comes after the President met up with  respected North Korean official SirBryanHall in Toronto, and signed a treaty that protected the cats in the country of Liechtenstein, which is currently controlled by the Hall Dynasty and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, however SirBryanHall broke this treaty, and has caused the President to pursue action. In the past, the Republic of Korea Armed Forces have failed twice to take back the micro-state.

It’s unknown at the time what would happen if South Korea won the war, with it being guessed that the South Korean Government would restore Liechtenstein back to its original form of self-ruling government.
