## Korea at its knees, Speaker of the National Assembly Defects.

*Written by Josh05485*

One of Korea's most prestigious members, Funzone73, has stepped down from all positions of ROK, ROKN, and ROKMC. With him defecting to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. With Korea's National Assembly having had 2 Speakers in 2 months, Private_Teddy the former Speaker before Funzone73, stepped down due "complications" with the job of Speaker. This comes at a difficult time for the National Assembly due to not having a Deputy Speaker, and some parties not even having Chairmans. The question comes up, when will Korea get back up from the pressure, and when will we have a tough Speaker?
