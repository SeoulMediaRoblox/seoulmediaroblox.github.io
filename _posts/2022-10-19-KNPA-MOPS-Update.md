## KNPA and MoPS will soon be able to hold trials on the JSA

The KNPA and MoPS, following an announcement a month ago by JimmySavil4, will be receiving the power to hold trials when arresting someone in an upcoming update.

JimmySavil4 also announced that KNPA and MoPS will no longer be able to receive promotions, and ranks through gamepasses or rank transfers, but instead for there to be a "new automated tryout system for them with EXP as the currency of promotion." This system will also be applying to the following ROK and DPRK divisions: KPAAF / KPANF / ROKNF / ROKAF.
