## The ROK Navy Scandal: Free ranking or rank transfers? 

Recently, it's come to the surface that the Republic of Korea Navy, South Korea’s Naval Force, has been caught in a scandal of what seems like free ranking, as shown in multiple screenshots below. 

The Republic of Navy offers rank transfers to members from other branches without the approval of those branches, which has been a very controversial action, however has increased activity. However this action has made the Republic of Korea Navy very Officer heavy, with a lot of those officers also taking high-ranking positions.

I think that’s enough talk, it's time for you to see what I’m talking about for yourself.
