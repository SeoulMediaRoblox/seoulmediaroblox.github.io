# BREAKING NEWS: Recent Evidence Reveals That The Presidential Election Was STOLEN

## Introduction
On the 18th of January, 2025, it was announced that an “Emergency Presidential Election” were to be hosted following the assassination of Former President Sirigglythe4rd. Three candidates from the previous election ran to complete the Former President’s term. These candidates were: Carlos_TheFurry (DPK), Josh_Simil (UKIP), and JackDesires (PPP). The two candidates to proceed to the second round of the election (hosted on the 19th of January) being Josh_Simil and Carlos. 

The second round results were released on the next day, the 21st of January. Now President Carlos managed to win with 101 votes, 13 more than Josh. Many were straight to criticise Carlos for how he managed to seek a 36 vote increase without the backing of JackDesires, who endorsed Candidate Josh. Seoul Media Group, after being shown evidence of possible electoral fraud, investigated.

Our investigation found that at least two people were guilty of importing voters from other groups, them being (now former): Prime Minister sourishnandy and Deputy Prime Minister enriu2009. The two individuals are suspected to have used groups from different and completely separate communities in which they hold high ranks to import votes.
## Sourishnady
Sourishnandy, ranked Chief Executive in the Indian group “[Bharatiya Studio's](https://www.roblox.com/communities/32829892/Bharatiya-Studios#!/about)” was found to have likely invited at least 6 individuals, with at least 4 of them becoming Registered Voters. Such an act is understood by many to be blatant electoral interference from unrelated groups. Multiple of these individuals were/are friends of Sournish on Discord. Sournishnandy, when asked to comment, responded first by avoiding the question asked, saying: “You first give me the answer of who send you the cabinet document”. Upon further questioning Sournish claimed “"No, we didn't rig the elections, what do you mean?".
After being revealed the evidence by Seoul Media Group, he responded “I didnt invited them, plus the only person I am friend with is rocket who doesnt have registered voter”. Sournishnandy would later fail to seek the approval of the National Assembly to obtain the post of Prime Minister, however remains as Party Leader of the DPK.
## enri2009
enri2009, ranked as “Ministro Della Difesa (Minister of Defence) in “[Italy Division](https://www.roblox.com/communities/34308528/Italy-Division#!/about)” was found to have imported 5 individuals, with 4 of them being registered voters. Enri2009 when questioned about concerns of voter importation responded “I invited only 3 peeople that day, and it was to play with them. None of them was able to vote as they all didn't have the Registered Voted role.” Seoul Media in its investigation discovered that 5 members of the “Italy Division” joined the ROK, and 4 of them were registered voters.
## President Carlos 
An exclusive interview between Seoul Media Group CEO WeGucciT0day and President Carlos revealed the following. Carlos denied any involvement in any rigging or importation of voters. However, upon further questioning sent a screenshot, showing enri2009 was found to admit to bringing in ~20 votes in total, making the new total of possible illegitimate votes to at least 24 if the statement is found to truthful. Such a decrease in voters would have meant that Carlos_theFurry in the Second round should have had a total of 77 votes, coming second in the election when compared to the 88 votes of Josh_Simil, meaning that **Carlos_theFurry should not be the President of the Republic of Korea, but instead Josh_Simil.** It should be noted, that it's still unknown to what level the President was involvement.
