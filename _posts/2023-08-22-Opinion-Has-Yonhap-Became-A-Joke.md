## Opinion: Has Yonhap became a joke?

Yonhap, South Korea’s supposedly major News Network, and KNCA as a whole, since the collapse of Seoul Today has seen major inactivity, and a lack in quality. With all Private News Networks folding into inactivity, since the removal of the Robloxruler87 from power, and the forced Premiership of JimmySavil4. Now that South Korea has levelled out once again to a more democratic, and free state, we see lack of quality and quantity within the South Korean Media industry. 

Yonhap today posted an article with the headline *“RECIPE: Instant Iced Tea”*. Whilst there is plenty of news to report on, especially with the upcoming Presidential Election, and the removal of the Minister of the Interior from leadership. Yonhap, a Government Run Organisation seems to be informing the people how to make Instant Iced Tea, instead of what matters. 

The article previously mentioned was written 10 days before the previous article. Under Section 5.5 of the Media and News Network regulations Act of 2023 (N.A. 0089) it states *“A News Network must produce two or more articles/videos per week.”* Whilst this law is up to the Minister of Culture to uphold, which also runs Yonhap, and isn’t enforced, shouldn’t Yonhap at least attempt to write more articles per week? 

To conclude, Yonhap has become a joke, with #knca has been inactive most of the last 3 months. Maybe a change in administration is needed..
