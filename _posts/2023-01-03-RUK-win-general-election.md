## The "Reform UK" Party wins the January 2023 General Election

The new Reform UK party, created and lead by JimmySavil4, has won the January 2023 General Election with an almost landslide victory. Reform UK party, often being considered a satirical party. Reform UK, formed a collation with BIP, PPP, PLM, TKP, and JSR, with no opposition being able to create a collation to counter the one put forward by JimmySavill4. JimmySavill4 has formed the following Cabinet: 

Prime Minister - @AndrewBrexitJones (AKA JimmySavill4) 
Deputy Prime Minister - @WeGucciT0day 

Presidential Chief of Staff - @AlphaL1m1ted 
First Lady of South Korea - @snaillove2004 
Minister of Defence - @staidIy 
Minister of the Interior - @Private_Teddy 
Minister of Foreign Affairs - @Nocturno_Plays 
Minister of Justice - @ParasieI 
Minister of Culture - @Funzone73 

People however have questioned if Reform UK should be treated seriously, or just as a gag - after all, it's a British party in a Korean country. Reform UK is most notably known for it's parties slogan "Brexit means Brexit", with JimmySavill4 saying in the past that he will make the ROK leave the EU.
