The SWC were lead by the cudax1 an expirenced and skilled player in 'TPS' (third person shooter) combat. The scrim used a capture point system, with the point rotating every few minutes. Every second one side held the point, they gain a point. The SWC won 1000-484. The scrim started with the Forces tying, until the Special Warfare Command managed to up there game, and proceed to dominate the final portion of the scrim.

The Special Warfare Command responded pointing out that the smae person was caught 'tea bagging' on individuals from the SWC whom they eliminated. This brings up the question, is the SWC the superior Special Force, or were they just lucky?

The SWC and the SOF were planning to clash in a scrim later, however the SOF backed out.
